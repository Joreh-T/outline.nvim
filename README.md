# ‚ö†Ô∏è  NOTE: THIS IS A FORK

This is a fork of the original symbols-outline.nvim which merges some selected
PRs from the original repo, plus some other improvements due to personal
preferences.

It does not attempt to be an up-to-date successor of the original repo, nor does
it attempt to ensure everyone's use-cases are satisfied by providing an overall
better experience. It is merely a fork which I maintain for my personal
use-cases which incorporates some selected PRs.

## Maintenance status

This fork is NOT guaranteed to be completely bug-free, nor as stable as the
original. However, since I use this plugin myself, it is guaranteed that
selected issues that I encounter myself would be fixed (to the best of my
ability).

I do not merge PRs from the original repo that I don't personally need.

- **DO use this fork if**:
  - You want to use features available in this fork, which are not included
  upstream (listed below)
  - You MIGHT want some up-to-date fixes to problems (that I also face) but is
  OK with some things not being looked after well (things I don't personally use)

- **Do NOT use this fork if**:
  - You want a stable plugin
  - You don't need the extra features in this fork

## Features

Below is a list of features I've included in this fork which, at the time of
writing, has not been included upstream (in the original repo). I try my best to
keep this list up to date.

- Feat: Toggling folds (and added default keymaps for it)
(simrat39/symbols-outline.nvim#194)
- Feat: when `auto_close=true` only auto close if `goto_location` is used (where
focus changed), and not for `focus_location` (simrat39/symbols-outline.nvim#119)

- Fix `SymbolsOutlineClose` crashing when already closed: simrat39/symbols-outline.nvim#163 (simrat39/symbols-outline.nvim#168)
- Support Nerd fonts v3.0: simrat39/symbols-outline.nvim#225
- Fix newlines in symbols crash: simrat39/symbols-outline.nvim#204 (simrat39/symbols-outline.nvim#184)
- Fix `code_actions`: simrat39/symbols-outline.nvim#168 (simrat39/symbols-outline.nvim#123)
- Fix fold all operation too slow: simrat39/symbols-outline.nvim#223 (simrat39/symbols-outline.nvim#224)

# symbols-outline.nvim

**A tree like view for symbols in Neovim using the Language Server Protocol.
Supports all your favourite languages.**

![demo](https://github.com/simrat39/rust-tools-demos/raw/master/symbols-demo.gif)

## Prerequisites

- `neovim 0.7+`
- Properly configured Neovim LSP client

## Installation

Use `hedyhli/symbols-outline.nvim` if you wish to use this fork.

Packer:
```lua
use 'simrat39/symbols-outline.nvim'
```

Lazy:
```lua
{
  "simrat39/symbols-outline.nvim",
  config = function()
    -- Example mapping to toggle symbols-outline
    vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>tt", "<cmd>SymbolsOutline<CR>",
      { desc = "SymbolsOutline" })

    require("symbols-outline").setup {
      -- Your setup opts here (optional)
    }
  end,
},
```

## Setup

Put the setup call in your init.lua or any lua file that is sourced.

**NOTE**: A call to `.setup()` is *required* for this plugin to work!
(simrat39/symbols-outline.nvim#213)

```lua
require("symbols-outline").setup()
```

## Configuration

Pass a table to the setup call above with your configuration options.

```lua

  highlight_hovered_item = true,
  show_guides = true,
  auto_preview = false,
  position = 'right',
  relative_width = true,
